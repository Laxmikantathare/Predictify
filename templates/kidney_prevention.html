        <h5>Manage alcohol intake</h5>
        <p>Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can cause your blood pressure and cholesterol levels to rise to unhealthy levels.

            Sticking to the recommended alcohol limit is the best way to reduce your risk:<br>
            <ul>
            <li>men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week</li>
            <li>spread your drinking over 3 days or more if you drink as much as 14 units a week</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar levels carefully. Talk with your health care team about treatment options. Your doctor may recommend certain lifestyle changes to help keep your blood sugar under control. These actions will help reduce your risk for kidney disease.</p>
        <h5>Be careful with painkillers</h5>
        <p>Kidney disease can be caused by taking too many non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, or taking them for longer than recommended. Always ask questions if you don’t understand something. Never stop taking your medicine without first talking to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.</p>
